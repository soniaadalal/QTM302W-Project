## Objectives and Goals

- To analyze the relationship between US deportations and violent crime in Latin America and the Caribbean.
- To explore the influence of deportation rates, corruption scores, and income groups on homicide rates.
- To provide insights into the potential factors contributing to violence in the region.

- Statistical Modeling
- Data Visualization

## Platforms/Languages

- R
- RStudio
- HTML

## Project Description

Our project focuses on understanding the impact of US deportations on levels of violent crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, based on the study "Exporting Murder: US deportations and the Spread of Violence". We explore various factors, including deportation rates, corruption scores, and income groups, to investigate their associations with homicide rates in the region.

### Research Questions

Our research aims to investigate deportation as one of the major factors corresponding to violence in the country of origin. 

Hypothesis: There exists a correlation between income groups, deportation rates, corruption, and  homicide rates

Higher deportation may be associated with higher homicide rates. 
Deportation of lower-income groups may be associated with higher homicide rates. 
Lower corruption scores indicating higher percieved corruption of the government may be associated with higher homicide rates. 

### Models and Visualization Techniques
The repository includes code for generating various visualizations to analyze the relationships between different variables in the dataset. This includes correlation plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and line plots to provide insights into the data.

### Current Challenges
- Currently, we are facing the limitation of a time gap. The data set provides data from 2004 to 2014 which may be too small of a timeline to see a trend. 

### Next Steps (Future Directions)
- Our next steps include getting more comprehensive data perhaps for specific countries within the Latin American & Caribbean region to really get a understanding of the true factors that can affect violence.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the raw data being kept in files/dataset within this repository
3. Run the notebook to reproduce the analysis that is being kepy in notebooks/EDA


###  EDA Code Notebook: 
Our exploratory data analysis (EDA) code notebook, which includes code to replicate and further explore our findings.
### Data Files: 
Any datasets used in our analysis will be included in the "data" folder.
### Replicating Environment
Includes renv files that enable users to clone this repository to replicate the computing environment with the libraries our analysis depended on.

Feel free to explore the materials in this repository and replicate our analysis. We encourage collaboration and further exploration of the topics covered in our project.
